What does it feel like when the AI tools you helped build are the first to threaten your own job?

Let me start with my own story. I work at a US tech company as a product manager. My domain is AI Infrastructure—in plain terms, I build the highways in the AI world so models can run faster and more powerful models can be trained more quickly.

Last summer, our company went through massive layoffs. They were ruthless. Despite being a self-proclaimed leading AI company, despite our org being a core AI org, despite us being the people supposedly relocated from China to the US because we were "AI talent"—when the axe fell, none of that mattered. Many colleagues were let go. The criteria seemed random, bearing little relation to individual capability. I experienced severe anxiety during that period. Even though I wasn't laid off, I was genuinely shaken. I felt AI was the root of all evil. It was bitterly ironic—my work, and the work of many laid-off colleagues, was to accelerate AI development. And once it bore fruit, the first heads to roll were ours. I spent a long time adjusting my mindset, chatting with ChatGPT more than I'd like to admit. GPT's emotional support actually helped. But more importantly, with support from family and friends, I slowly emerged from the anxiety and found myself again.

From my own experience, combined with keeping up with AI developments for work, my strongest impression is this: AI is advancing terrifyingly fast. I don't know how many people AI has already displaced, but I believe this wave of disruption will reach far more people. Yet I rarely see this being discussed—which is why I'm writing this.

Looking at recent layoff data from major tech companies, engineers were hit hardest, followed by product managers. The logic is simple: AI coding is currently the fastest-advancing area, so fewer engineers are needed. Fewer engineers means fewer PMs. It's a domino effect—engineers and PMs are first. But these are people who understand technology, who specialize in automation. What will they do next? I suspect many will scatter across industries, automating other fields. There's another factor: AI coding is advancing fastest because that's where the world's brightest minds are concentrated. Once that work is largely done, those minds will turn to the next domain (this is already happening), and the next wave of people will be affected...

According to statistics, nearly 400,000 people were laid off in the US in 2025. The 2020 peak of nearly 2 million was pandemic-driven. I don't know when the next peak will come—emotionally, I hope not soon; rationally, I think it will be soon. At Davos, Anthropic CEO Dario predicted that within 1-5 years, 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs will disappear because AI can do them.

AI tools like Claude Coworker can now expand to various roles—sales, marketing, and more. The impact clearly extends beyond coding and will soon sweep through white-collar work. Jobs with clear answers, jobs that are easy to verify—those are easiest to replace.

All this is to say: AI displacement is happening now. I hope readers take this seriously.

But I'm not writing this to spread anxiety. I just emerged from anxiety myself. I know excessive worry is painful and counterproductive. Here's what I learned about moving past the fear and reclaiming agency:

The first response is adjusting your mindset—the most important thing, in my view. When the layoffs happened, I was anxious. I thought AI was pure evil. Being an AI practitioner whose job might be eliminated by the very AI I helped create felt absurd and bleak. I blamed the company's heartlessness, cursed the times, wallowed in anxiety and self-pity. If you feel this way about AI, that's normal. Fear in the face of massive change is normal. Blaming your environment, your company, even yourself—these are normal reactions. But dwelling there doesn't help. The tide of history keeps moving. AI won't slow down one bit just because you or I aren't ready. Competition between employees, companies, even nations is fierce. No one dares slow down, fearing they'll fall behind. So abandon the illusions and prepare. Change happens constantly. What we can control is how we face it.

There's much more to say about mindset—accepting your emotions, recognizing that anxiety is trying to protect you, staying connected with family and friends, not tying your entire identity to work. I won't elaborate here; I've written extensively about my journey in my "One Year in America" series.

Once your mindset stabilizes, the second step is embracing AI. After I steadied myself, I deliberately started using AI more in daily work and life. It was like opening a door to a new world. Today's AI applications and tools are genuinely incredible. Here are some of my daily use cases:

1. English is my working language but not my native tongue. Anything I don't understand, I have AI explain—including the cultural context behind certain expressions. Sometimes I know every word but miss the subtext, so I ask AI to decode it. Its English is better than mine anyway.
2. I don't write documents from scratch anymore. I just talk through ideas with AI, let it ask me questions to clarify my thinking, then have it organize our conversation into a document.
3. I'd always wanted a personal website but never got around to it—there's a technical threshold. AI handled the code and deployment in one evening.
4. When I need to ramp up on a new domain for work, I let AI help me learn. It filters worthwhile papers, summarizes them, writes code, answers my questions, asks me questions. Learning happens so much faster now.
5. I use AI as a coach. Work challenges, situations I don't know how to handle—I run them by AI. There's always something useful in the response, and it's pretty much cured my workplace overthinking.

After using AI tools, my deepest realization is how dramatically my capabilities have expanded. It's like having a master of eighteen martial arts by my side. Before, not knowing how to code, imperfect English, sometimes imprecise expression—these were real constraints on my growth. Now those constraints have nearly vanished. My own processing bandwidth has become the new bottleneck.

Another observation: the more I use AI, the more ideas I have, the better my ideas get. My periods of heaviest AI use coincide with my most active thinking. Using it, new ideas keep popping up, and I can't wait to try them with AI. As I used it more, I naturally started sharing my methods with colleagues, organizing AI learning sessions, gradually becoming the team's AI pioneer.

From resisting AI and drowning in AI anxiety to becoming an "AI pioneer"—that took only about six months. I'm not completely free of anxiety now, but I'm in a much healthier place than before. This is my story, my transformation. If you want to embrace AI, you can absolutely do it too.

How are you responding to the challenges AI brings? Let's discuss in the comments.
