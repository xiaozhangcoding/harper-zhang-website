Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm excited to finally have this space up and running.

## What to Expect

This blog will be a place where I share:

- **Thoughts and reflections** on things I'm learning
- **Stories** from daily life and adventures
- **Creative projects** I'm working on
- **Things I find interesting** from around the web

## Why I Started This Blog

I've always enjoyed writing, and having a personal corner of the internet feels like a cozy way to share ideas and connect with others. In a world of social media snippets, there's something nice about having a space for longer-form thoughts.

## A Note on Photos and Videos

This blog supports images and embedded videos. Here's how you can use them:

### Adding Images

Simply include images in your markdown like this:

```markdown
![Alt text for your image](/path-to-your-image.jpg)
```

Place your images in the `public` folder and reference them with a leading `/`.

### Embedding Videos

For YouTube or Vimeo videos, you can use the video container class for responsive embedding:

```html
<div class="video-container">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
    frameborder="0"
    allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>
```

## What's Next

I'm looking forward to sharing more here. If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out through my [contact page](/contact).

Thanks for stopping by!
