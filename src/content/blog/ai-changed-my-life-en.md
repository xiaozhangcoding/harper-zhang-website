Today I'll tell the story of Harper. (Harper is my English name)

Harper is a small-town girl, grew up in an 18th-tier county deep in the Qinling Mountains. As a child, Harper was well-behaved and obedient, loved reading. Compared to other kids her age, Harper found studying pretty interesting, especially Chinese literature and history — it was like reading storybooks. Gradually Harper became "someone else's kid," always getting first place in middle school. In high school, math and physics were obviously hard to grasp, but Harper still successfully got into BUPT (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications), not a 985 university, but supposedly great for job prospects.

During college, Harper felt pretty lost. She studied telecommunications engineering because it was BUPT's best major. Could barely keep up with the coursework, but had no real interest. Harper always felt BUPT's tech atmosphere was too intense, even at meals the students at the table behind were discussing code. Harper would purse her lips, having no idea what they were talking about. Before she knew it, graduation was approaching, hadn't figured out what job to look for, so she took the grad school entrance exam. During her master's, didn't study much, but did plenty of other things. Spent half a year on exchange in Finland, traveled around Europe, did several internships, even played in quite a few table tennis competitions. Soon it was really time to graduate and find a job. With the mindset of not wanting to write code, by chance Microsoft gave Harper a product manager offer, and just like that she stayed in Beijing, began her working life on Danling Street.

At first Harper worked in the Office group, everything was good, just too chill. Two years later, Harper proactively transferred to a machine learning-related team, work became more fulfilling. Gradually, Harper met a lovely guy. Dating, marriage, settling down in Beijing. Life had occasional troubles, but overall was peaceful and warm.

November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was released, and everything hit the fast-forward button.

Harper first learned about ChatGPT from her direct manager. His expression was excited, saying he'd seen something incredibly powerful that he'd never seen before. After that the team started working overtime, reading papers, discussing with sibling teams, designing products, talking to customers. Harper remembers colleagues remarking that every day in this field brought something new, every day felt as lively as Chinese New Year. At the time Harper didn't pay much attention to all this excitement, because her baby was about to be born.

The first week back from maternity leave, a bombshell announcement dropped from the sky — the company was moving the entire team abroad. Harper was stunned hearing this news. As a hometown-loving small-town girl born and raised in China, Harper had never thought about living abroad. Maybe she'd once envied study abroad classmates traveling the world, but what did living abroad even mean? Harper had no concept. Life is so interesting like that, always giving you mutations you never could have dreamed of. After a long time of discussion, agonizing, and weighing options, Harper boarded the flight from Beijing to Seattle with the mindset of "the whole family going out to play for a few years then coming back."

One important reason Harper wanted to come to America was thinking American work would be more relaxed, could spend more time playing with her kid. Never expected that less than six months after arriving in the US, it was "AI can already write 30% of code," "XX company laying off 15,000 people," "one person + AI can replace a 10-person team" everywhere. Harper's company also started layoffs. In this wave of layoffs, Harper barely survived, but felt 10,000 points of shock inside. For a while, Harper was extremely anxious. At that time, her Xiaohongshu feed was full of how to overcome anxiety, but after reading, felt even more anxious. At that time Harper thought, I'm done for, and AI is the root of all evil — if not for this damn AI I'd still be living my good life in Beijing, why did I come to America asking for trouble. Later, after a period of struggle (see the "My First Year in the US" series for details), Harper figured it out — it's just a job, no need to push myself to the point of being physically and mentally unhealthy. Harper also had an epiphany — the world is just this impermanent. Fighting against change is futile, what you need to learn is acceptance.

After going through this struggle, Harper felt reborn. No longer anxious about AI, but seeing AI's enormous influence. Harper's own story is the best example — if not for AI technology's development, Harper would most likely still be in Beijing. Harper thinks AI should serve people, not replace people. At the same time, Harper feels that as a big tech company employee, she felt AI's impact relatively early. In the coming years this impact will likely radiate to more people — some will lose their jobs because of AI, some will discover their unique value because of AI. Perhaps many people will go through a similar process — anxiety, crisis, frustration, anger, even despair. In this process, Harper thinks the most important thing is to believe in yourself, maintain hope.

So Harper wants to share her story, hoping it can help more people. Harper believes that adapting to AI is the theme of our times for the next decade. Everyone will face varying degrees of impact, struggle, pain, before finding their unique value. Harper firmly believes everyone will find their place in the world, including AI.

Wait and hope.
